## Communication policy & LinkedIN network policy
<Important: read this first, to the end. 𝐄𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 marketing and 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐫𝐮𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬: see (*)(**)>
I block all unsolicited direct marketing to my InMail or LinkedIn messaging.

If we did not meet yet, first 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐬𝐞𝐥𝐟 and tell me 𝐰𝐡𝐲 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐢𝐧𝐯𝐢𝐭𝐞 𝐦𝐞. 
What can we do for each other? What is your added value?

When we have met F2F, discussed or worked on interesting topics, let's connect right away. 

To assure the quality of my professional network, I hate and ignore blank invites from just anyone, I refuse anonymous calls. 

From GDPR point of view: you do NOT have permission to use my LinkedIn mail address or any data for marketing shit.

(*) BTW: "Freelance" means: no permanent nor full time employee jobs, no relocation.

(**) I <was> developer in my stone age.. So don't bother sending (application) dev jobs.
